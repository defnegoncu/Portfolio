MOTIONRUN is a university group project designed to run with the ART DTrack system to offer a kinematic gameplay experience.
	For ease of demonstration gameplay videos are included in the folder and Keyboard controlls are added to the game itself.
	I was responsible of
		providing the Sound effects and their integration,
		implementing all the Collusion and Trigger effects in the game,
		including the Highscore System.
	I also helped in implementation of player input and in various other scripts.

AI_CODE folder consists of some of the classes I wrote as a part of the AI for Games course. Sadly I do not own the rights to Vektoria game engine to share the executable file. 

DRAWING_MODELLING Folder is where you can find my pencil drawing portfolio, along with some Blender models.
